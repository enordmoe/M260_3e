## Two Primary Methods of Data Collection {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   **Observational study** observing individuals and measuring variables of interest without attempting to influence responses.
    -   Purpose: descriptive, study of associations\
    -   Examples: Health surveys, retrospective studies, field observations
-   **Experiment** a study in which the researcher actively controls one or more of the explanatory variables.
    -   Purpose: investigate cause-and-effect relationships\
    -   Examples: tests of new drugs ([Salk Polio vaccine trial](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/polio-vaccine-trials-begin), [Covid Vaccine Trials](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577) ), classic agricultural experiments ([Rothamsted research](https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/long-term-experiments))

## A Quote

> "The invalid assumption that correlation implies cause is probably among the two or three most serious and common errors of human reasoning."

Stephen Jay Gould

## Association is not Causation! {.build}

-   Two variables are **associated** if values of one variable tend to be related to the values of the other variable.

-   Two variables are **causally associated** if changing the value of one variable influences the value of the other variable.

    -   Temporal precedence
    -   Covariation ($A \rightarrow B$, $\tilde A \rightarrow \tilde B$)
    -   No plausible alternative explanation

## Confounding

A third variable that is associated with *both* the explanatory variable and the response variable is called a **confounding variable**

-   Plausible explanation for an association between explanatory and response variables

-   Prevents determining causation.

## Exercise and Depression

-   The article headline: ["Huge New Study Shows Why Exercise Should Be The First Choice in Treating Depression"](https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-new-study-shows-why-exercise-should-be-the-first-choice-in-treating-depression)

-   The underlying study: ["Effectiveness of physical activity interventions for improving depression, anxiety and distress: an overview of systematic reviews"](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/18/1203)

-   Is the headline valid? Why or why not?

## Dental X-rays and Cancer

-   The headline: "Dental X-rays Linked to Brain Tumors"

-   [The lead sentence](http://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20120410/dental-x-rays-linked-brain-tumors): "Getting frequent dental X-rays appears to increase the risk for a commonly diagnosed brain tumor, a new study finds."

-   The [abstract](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.26625/abstract)

-   The [NBC News Story](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/dental-x-rays-may-raise-risk-of-brain-tumor-44453955975)

-   The [NutritionFacts.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYGkvMwqyys) take on the study.

# Correlation does NOT imply causation... no matter how conclusive the results sound. {background-color="aquamarine"}

## Correlation and Causation

Do you agree? Or can you identify confounding variables?

::: incremental
1.  **Vitamin C and Colds:** "Since people who take vitamin C supplements seem to get fewer colds, taking vitamin C must prevent colds."

2.  **Exercise and Heart Disease:** "Heart disease rates are lower in people who exercise regularly, so exercise must directly prevent heart disease."

3.  **Organic Food and Health:** "People who eat organic food are healthier, so organic food must be the cause of better health."

## Study of the Effect of Arthroscopic Knee Surgery

About 700,000 arthroscopic partial meniscectomies performed annually in the United States

-   Are they effective?

-   Is an experiment feasible?

-   How to design a study to assess its effectiveness?

## Principles of Statistical Design of Experiments

1.  Random allocation into experimental groups

    -   Eliminate confounding factors by **randomization**

2.  Control the effect of outside variables

    -   A **control group** is a group of subjects from which the treatment of interest is withheld.

3.  Replication on many subjects to reduce chance variation

## Control by blinding

<!-- Use knee surgery study to motivate additional control mechanisms-->

-   **Placebo** a fake treatment that simulates the idea of a treatment of interest

    -   Placebo effect: people experience the effect they think they should be experiencing, even if they arenâ€™t actually receiving the treatment

-   **Double-blind study** neither the participant nor the evaluator knows the participant's treatment

## Arthroscopic Knee Surgery Study (cont'd) {.build}

-   ["Arthrosscopic Partial Meniscectomy versus Sham Surgery for a Degenerative Meniscal Tear"](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1305189)

-   Does the evidence suggest that arthroscopic surgery is more effective than a sham surgery?

## Randomized Experiment in Practice

-   The different levels of the explanatory variable are known as **treatments**

-   Randomly divide the units into groups.

    -   Use R

-   Randomly assign a different treatment to each group.

-   If the treatments are randomly assigned, the **treatment groups** should all look similar.

## Does a Small Amount of Exercise Raise Pulse Rates? {.smaller}

Is just 10 seconds of exercise enough to increase pulse rates measurably?

-   **Treatment groups**: (1) seated or (2) exercise 10 seconds

-   Randomly divide the class into two groups

-   Obtain baseline pulse rate (beats per 30 seconds)

-   Administer the treatment

    -   Running in place for 10 seconds.

-   Measure pulse after treatment (rate in beats per 30 seconds)

    -   Compute response=change in pulse (after-before)

## Using R to Randomly Assign Treatments {.smaller}

-   Randomly assign students in **classlist**

```{r, eval=F}
library(mosaic)
classlist<- data.frame(names =c("Annalise Bailey", "Ethan Barnes", "Styx Bonebrake", "Yvette Boyse-Peacor", 
"Jay Breck", "Amaia Cadenas", "Isabel Chiang", "Logan Coller", 
"MacKenzie Cruz", "Lareen Darwesh", "Lucas De Almeida", "Sofia Fleming", 
"Wes Grinwis", "Cassie Grotelueschen", "Celina Haase", "Luke Johnson-Sears", 
"Huin Lee", "Grace Lounds", "Madi Magda", "Andrew Mallon", "Cedric May", 
"Ameera Mirza", "Allie Nutt", "Astrid Parker", "Mia Pascuzzi", 
"Sofie Santos", "Tobin Schiller", "Maddy Vrba", "Emerson Wesselhoff", 
"Shun Yonehara")
)
head(classlist)
```

## Using R to Randomly Assign Treatments (cont'd)

-   Use `shuffle()` function to shuffle rows

```{r, eval = F}
newlist <- shuffle(classlist)
head(newlist)
```

## Using R to Randomly Assign Treatments (cont'd)

-   Assign the first half to group 1 and second half to group 2,...\

```{r,eval=F}
# Group 1: Run in place for 10 seconds
newlist[1:15,]
# Group 2: Remain Seated
newlist[16:30,]
```

## Pulse Data Experiment

Access the survey and report your results:

::: aside
You may opt out if you prefer to not participate.

## Two Types of Randomized Experiments {.build}

1.  In a **randomized comparative experiment**, we randomly assign cases to different treatment groups and then compare results on the response variable(s).

2.  In a **matched pairs experiment**, each case gets both treatments in random order (or cases get paired up in some other obvious way), and we examine individual differences in the response variable between the two treatments.

## Matched Pairs

**Matched pairs** designs:

-   Each participant is their own control (pre-vs-post) OR

-   Participants are paired and a randomly selected member of each pair gets each treatment OR

-   Each participant gets both treatments in a random order

## A Matched Pairs Study: Gatorade and Running

-   Does drinking Gatorade make you run faster?

::: notes
-   **Variables:**

    -   *Explanatory*: drink Gatorade or placebo before running\
    -   *Response*: time to run a certain distance (a mile?)

-   **Completely randomized:** Randomize half of the people to drink Gatorade half to drink a placebo.

-   **Matched pairs:** have each person run twice (on different days?), one time drinking Gatorade, one time drinking placebo. Randomize order.
