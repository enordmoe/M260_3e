# Type I and Type II Errors

|----------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| $H_0$ is true  | Type I Error $(\alpha)$ |         No error        |

# Type I and Type II Errors (cont'd)

## Type I Error

* False positive   

* Convicting an innocent person 

--
   
## Type II Error

* False negative    

* Absolving a guilty person

# Significance Level  

The significance level, $\alpha$, represents the tolerable probability of making a Type I error.  

---

# Multiple Testing

*  When multiple hypothesis tests are conducted, the chance that at least one test incorrectly rejects a true null hypothesis increases with the number of tests.

*  If the null hypotheses are all true, $\alpha$ of the tests will yield statistically significant results just by random chance.

## Publication Bias

* **Publication bias** refers to the fact that usually only the significant results get published.

* The one study that turns out significant gets published, and no one knows about all the insignificant results.

* This combined with the problem of multiple comparisons, can yield very misleading results.


---

## Replicating Results  

By attempting to *replicate* significant results with another study, this second study can either:  

a. reject $H_0$, providing further confirmation that $H_a$ is true

b. fail to reject $H_0$, suggesting that the first study may have yielded a Type I error.

## Practical vs Statistical Significance

* With small sample sizes, even large differences or effects may not be significant.

* With large sample sizes, even a very small difference or effect can be significant.

* A statistically significant result is not always practically significant, especially with large sample sizes.
