## Section 4.4 Topics

-   **Type I and Type II Errors**
    -   Understand false positives (Type I) and false negatives (Type II) in hypothesis testing.
-   **Multiple Testing & Publication Bias**
    -   Explore how running multiple tests and selective reporting can lead to misleading conclusions.
-   **Practical vs. Statistical Significance**
    -   Differentiate between statistically significant results and results that are practically meaningful.

## Type I and Type II Errors

|                |      Reject $H_0$       |   Do not reject $H_0$   |
|----------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| $H_0$ is true  | Type I Error $(\alpha)$ |        No error         |
| $H_0$ is false |        No error         | Type II Error $(\beta)$ |

<br>

### Type I Error $==>$ False positive

<br>

### Type II Error $==>$ False negative

## Significance Level

The significance level, $\alpha$, represents the tolerable probability of making a Type I error.

## Multiple Testing

-   When multiple hypothesis tests are conducted, the chance that **at** **least one test incorrectly rejects** a true null hypothesis increases with the number of tests.

-   If the null hypotheses are all true, a proportion $\alpha$ of the tests will yield statistically significant results **just by random chance**.

## Publication Bias

-   **Publication bias** refers to the fact that usually only the significant results get published.

-   The one study that turns out significant gets published, and no one knows about all the insignificant results.

-   This combined with the problem of multiple comparisons, can yield very misleading results.

## Replicating Results

By attempting to *replicate* significant results with another study, this second study can either:

-   Reject $H_0$, providing further confirmation that $H_a$ is true

OR

-   Fail to reject $H_0$, suggesting that the first study may have yielded a Type I error.

## Practical vs Statistical Significance

-   With small sample sizes, even large differences or effects may not be significant.

-   With large sample sizes, even a very small difference or effect can be significant.

-   A statistically significant result is not always practically significant, especially with large sample sizes.

## Bootstrap and Randomization Distributions

| Bootstrap Distributions | Randomization Distributions |
|:---------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| Our best guess at the distribution of sample statistics | Our best guess at the distribution of sample statistics, if $H_0$ were true |
| Centered around the observed sample statistic | Centered around the null hypothesized value |
| Simulate sampling from the population by resampling from the original sample | Simulate samples assuming $H_0$ were true |

## Key difference {background-color="#FAD9C7"}

<br> <br>

. . .

### Randomization distribution assumes $H_0$ true, <br> while a bootstrap distribution does *not*

## Intervals and Tests

<br>

-   If a 95% CI **contains** the parameter in $H_0$, then a two-tailed test should **not reject** $H_0$ at the 5% significance level.

. . .

<br>

-   If a 95% CI **misses** the parameter in $H_0$, then a two-tailed test should **reject** $H_0$ at the 5% significance level.

## Intervals and Tests

A confidence interval represents the **range of plausible values** for the population parameter:

-   If the null hypothesized value is **not within** the CI, it is **not a plausible** value and **should be rejected.**

. . .

-   If the null hypothesized value is **within** the CI, it **is a plausible** value and **should not be rejected.**

## Intervals and Tests

-   **Confidence intervals** give you a range of plausible values for the parameter.

. . .

-   A **significance test** describes the plausibility of one specific value of the parameter (through the $p$-value).

## Summary

::: incremental
-   If a null hypothesized value lies **inside** a 95% CI, a two-tailed test using $\alpha=.05$ would **not reject** $H_0$.

<span style="display: block; height: 5px;"></span>

-   If a null hypothesized value lies **outside** a 95% CI, a two-tailed test using $\alpha=.05$ would **reject** $H_0$.

<span style="display: block; height: 5px;"></span>

-   **Statistical significance** is not at all the same as **practical significance**.
