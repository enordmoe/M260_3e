# Formal Decisions

### If the $p$-value is small:

* **Reject $H_0$**
* the sample would be **extreme** if $H_0$ were true
* the results are **statistically significant**
* we have evidence for $H_a$

--

### If the $p$-value is **not** small:

* **Do not reject $H_0$**
* the sample would not be too extreme if $H_0$ were true
* the results are **not statistically significant**
* the test is **inconclusive**; either $H_0$ or $H_a$ may be true

---

# Significance Level

The **significance level $\alpha$** is the  threshold *below* which the $p$-value is deemed small enough to reject the null hypothesis.

+ $p$-value $<\alpha$ $\Longrightarrow$ Reject $H_0$

+ $p$-value $\ge \alpha$ $\Longrightarrow$ Do not reject $H_0$

The most common value of $\alpha$ is .05

* Values of .10 and .01 are also common.

# Significance Level

    + Reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$

* $p$-value $\ge\alpha$ $\Longrightarrow$ Results are **not statistically significant**
    + Test is inconclusive

# Never Accept the Null

* "Do not reject $H_0$" is not the same as "accept $H_0$"!

*  Lack of evidence against $H_0$ is **not** the same as evidence for $H_0$!

# Type I and Type II Errors

|                |       Reject $H_0$      |   Do not reject $H_0$   |
|----------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| $H_0$ is true  | Type I Error $(\alpha)$ |         No error        |
| $H_0$ is false |         No error        | Type II Error $(\beta)$ |

# Type I and Type II Errors (cont'd)

## Type I Error

* False positive   

* Convicting an innocent person 

--
   
## Type II Error

* False negative    

* Absolving a guilty person
