# Introduction

This document provides a guide to using `ggformula` graphics commands and the `mosaic` package in R for introductory statistics. The examples provided aim to help you understand the basic functionalities and expand your use of R in statistical analysis.

# Basic R Commands

## Loading Packages

Before you start using the commands, ensure that the necessary packages are installed and loaded:

```r
install.packages("ggformula")
install.packages("mosaic")
library(ggformula)
library(mosaic)
```

## Data Import

You can import data into R from various file types. For example, to import a CSV file:

```r
my_data <- read.csv("data.csv")
```

## Basic Data Manipulation

### Viewing the Data

To take a quick look at the data, you can use:

```r
head(my_data)
```

This command shows the first few rows of your dataset.

### Summary Statistics

To get a quick summary of your data, use:

```r
summary(my_data)
```

### Creating New Variables

You can create new variables within your dataset:

```r
my_data$new_variable <- my_data$existing_variable * 2
```

## Visualizations with ggformula

### Scatter Plot

To create a scatter plot of two variables:

```r
gf_point(y ~ x, data = my_data)
```

**Example:**

```r
gf_point(height ~ weight, data = my_data, color = ~gender)
```

This plots height against weight, using color to differentiate between genders.

### Histogram

To create a histogram of a variable:

```r
gf_histogram(~variable, data = my_data, bins = 30)
```

**Example:**

```r
gf_histogram(~age, data = my_data, bins = 20, fill = "blue")
```

### Boxplot

To create a boxplot comparing groups:

```r
gf_boxplot(y ~ group, data = my_data)
```

**Example:**

```r
gf_boxplot(score ~ class, data = my_data, color = ~class)
```

### Density Plot

To create a density plot:

```r
gf_density(~variable, data = my_data)
```

**Example:**

```r
gf_density(~age, data = my_data, fill = "red", alpha = 0.5)
```

## Statistical Analysis with Mosaic

### Summary Statistics

To calculate mean, median, and standard deviation:

```r
mean(~variable, data = my_data)
median(~variable, data = my_data)
sd(~variable, data = my_data)
```

**Example:**

```r
mean(~height, data = my_data)
median(~height, data = my_data)
sd(~height, data = my_data)
```

### Linear Modeling

To fit a linear model:

```r
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = my_data)
summary(model)
```

**Example:**

```r
model <- lm(height ~ weight, data = my_data)
summary(model)
```

### t-test

To perform a t-test comparing two groups:

```r
t.test(variable ~ group, data = my_data)
```

**Example:**

```r
t.test(score ~ class, data = my_data)
```

### ANOVA

To perform ANOVA:

```r
anova(lm(y ~ group, data = my_data))
```

**Example:**

```r
anova(lm(score ~ class, data = my_data))
```

## Conclusion

This guide provides basic examples and commands to get you started with data analysis in R using the `ggformula` and `mosaic` packages. Feel free to explore and expand these examples as you become more comfortable with the syntax and capabilities of R.
