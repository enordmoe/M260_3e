## Describing Quantitative Variables

Important characteristics of the *distribution* of quantitative variables

-   **Shape**: What is the *shape* of the distribution?

-   **Center**: Where are the data values *centered*?

-   **Spread**: How do the data *vary*?

# Section 2.2 One Quantitative Variable: <br> Shape and Center {background-color="#FAD9C7"}

## Dotplot

In a **dotplot**, each case of a quantitative variable is represented by a dot over the corresponding value.

-   Dots are stacked to show repeated values

-   Especially useful for relatively **small** datasets with repeated cases having the same value.

## Dotplot Example: Small Experiment {.smaller}

![](figs/tap.png){.absolute top="0" left="-200" height="100"}

-   Example dotplot for **CaffeineTaps** data set ($n=20$ participants)

-   Dots show number of finger taps for each study participant.

```{r}
gf_dotplot(~ Taps, dotsize = .5, data = CaffeineTaps)
```

## Dotplot Example: 3-Point Shots {.smaller}

![](figs/peter-berko-4ie4fXv7cX4-unsplash.jpg){.absolute top="0" left="-200" height="100"}

-   Example dotplot for **MiamiHeat** data set ($n=82$ games)

-   Dots show number of 3-point shots made per game for the 82-game season.

```{r}
gf_dotplot(~ FG3, dotsize = .5, data = MiamiHeat)
```

## Dotplot: Comments

-   The `dotsize` argument sets the size of the dots relative to the default value of 1 so `dotsize = .5` makes the dots 50% as large as the default size.

-   Caution: Note that the $y$-axis is meaningless here and can be ignored (or removed).

::: aside
**Note**: If you really need to remove the $y$-axis, you can use this advanced technical command.

```{r}
#| eval: false
gf_dotplot(~ FG3, dotsize = .5, data = MiamiHeat) %>% 
  gf_refine(scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL))
```
:::

## Histogram {.smaller}

![](figs/erik-jan-leusink-QTe-MHNUrz4-unsplash.jpg){.absolute top="0" right="-200" height="100"}

-   The height of each bar corresponds to the number of cases in the corresponding range of a quantitative variable.

-   Especially useful for relatively **large** datasets.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
gf_histogram(~ WeekdaySleep, data = SleepStudy)
```

## Histogram vs Bar Chart {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Bar chart

-   Use for categorical data
-   $x$-axis has no numerical scale
-   The number of bars is the number of categories
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### Histogram

-   Use for quantitative data
-   $x$-axis is numeric (drawn to scale)
-   The number of bars is set by judgement
-   Appearance differs depending on interval width

## Outlier

An **outlier** is an observed value that is notably distinct from the other values in a dataset. Usually, an outlier is much larger or much smaller than the rest of the data values.

-   A rule of thumb for identifying possible outliers is given in Section 2.4.

## Mean

The **mean** of the data values for a single quantitative variable is given by

$$
\text{Mean}=\frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}
$$

-   The mean of a sample is $\bar x$.

-   The mean of a population is denoted $\mu$.

-   The mean is the "balancing point" of a dotplot or histogram.

## R Examples: Mean

-   Mean of a single numerical variable:

```{r}
mean(~ WeekdaySleep, data = SleepStudy)
```

-   Mean of a single numerical variable for each category of a categorical variable:

```{r}
mean(WeekdaySleep~ EarlyClass, data = SleepStudy)
```

## Median

The **median**, $m$, of a quantitative variable is

-   the middle entry if there are an *odd* number of data values or

-   the average of the two middle values if there are an *even* number of data values.

-   The median divides the area of a histogram in half.

## R Examples: Median

-   Median of a single numerical variable:

```{r}
median(~ WeekdaySleep, data = SleepStudy)
```

-   Median of a single numerical variable for each category of a categorical variable:

```{r}
median(WeekdaySleep ~ EarlyClass, data = SleepStudy)
```

## Resistance

A statistic is **resistant** if it is relatively unaffected by extreme values.\
\* The median is resistant but the mean is not.\
\* When a distribution is skewed, the mean is pulled in the direction of the skewness.\
+ Right skewness $\Rightarrow$ mean \> median\
+ Left skewness $\Rightarrow$ mean \< median

# Section 2.3 One Quantitative Variable: <br> Measures of Spread {background-color="#FAD9C7"}

## Standard Deviation {.smaller}

The **standard deviation** for a quantitative variable measures the spread of the data.

$$
s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2}{n-1}}
$$

-   Gives a rough estimate of the *typical distance* of data values from the mean.

    -   $\mbox{Std Dev}\approx\sqrt{\mbox{average of (deviations from average)}^2}$

-   The larger the standard deviation, the greater the spread.

-   Has the same units as the original data.

## Intepreting the Standard Deviation: The 95% Rule

-   If a distribution of data is **approximately bell-shaped**, about 95% of the data should fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

-   For a sample, about 95% of the data should be between $\bar x-2s$ and $\bar x+2s$.

-   Note: In practice, this rule-of-thumb works reasonably well even when the data are not bell-shaped.

## Illustration of 95% Rule

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=3}
xbar=mean(~WeekdaySleep,data=SleepStudy)
st.dev=sd(~WeekdaySleep,data=SleepStudy)
epsilon=.001
ggplot(SleepStudy,aes(x=WeekdaySleep)) +
        geom_histogram(fill="white",color="black",breaks=seq(xbar-4*st.dev,xbar+4*st.dev,st.dev)) +
        geom_histogram(data=subset(SleepStudy,WeekdaySleep>=xbar-2*st.dev&WeekdaySleep<=xbar+2*st.dev),breaks=seq(xbar-4*st.dev,xbar+4*st.dev,st.dev),color="black", fill="red",alpha=.5)
```

-   Despite skewness, about 95% of data lies in the shaded area, between 7.87-2(1.17) and 7.87+2\*(1.17).\
-   Note: For this data, the proportion within two standard deviations is actually 246/253=.972 for these data.

## Percentile

The **p**$^\text{th}$ percentile is the value which is greather than p% of the data.

-   A test score in the 80th percentile is greater than at least 80% of the scores on the test.

## Example: 80th Percentile

-   Illustrate using an idealized smoothed histogram:

```{r}
quantile(~WeekdaySleep, data = SleepStudy, probs = c(.8))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=3}
#  calculate quantiles
qp8 <- quantile(~WeekdaySleep,data=SleepStudy,probs=c(.8))
# generate the plot
x=density(SleepStudy$WeekdaySleep,n=253)$x
y=density(SleepStudy$WeekdaySleep,n=253)$y
gg=data.frame(SleepStudy,x,y)
ggplot(SleepStudy) + stat_density(aes(x=WeekdaySleep),geom="line")+
        geom_ribbon(data=subset(gg,x<=qp8),
                    aes(x=x,ymax=y),ymin=0,fill="red", alpha=0.5)+
        geom_ribbon(data=subset(gg,x>=qp8),
                    aes(x=x,ymax=y),ymin=0,fill="blue", alpha=0.5)+
        annotate("text", x = 7, y = 0.08, label = "0.80")+
        annotate("text", x = 9.2, y = 0.08, label = "0.20")
```

## The z-Score

The $z$-score for a data value, $x$, from a sample mean mean $\bar x$ and standard deviation $s$ is defined to be $$
z-\text{score}=\frac{x-\bar x}{s}
$$

-   The $z$-score tells how many standard deviations the value is from the mean.

-   **Note:** For a population, replace $\bar x$ by $\mu$ and $s$ by $\sigma$.

## z-Scores

-   A z-score puts values on a common scale

-   Values farther from 0 are more extreme

-   For bell-shaped distributions, about 95% of all z-scores fall between -2 and 2

    -   Identify extreme values with $|z|>2$.

<!-- Carry out example(s) using  Which score is higher? -->

## z-Scores: Your turn

-   Is student 8 relatively more extreme on `DepressionScore` or `AnxietyScore`?\

```{r}
favstats(~DepressionScore, data = SleepStudy)
favstats(~AnxietyScore,data = SleepStudy)
SleepStudy[8, c("DepressionScore","AnxietyScore")]
```

## Other Measures of Location

-   **Maximum** largest data value

-   **Minimum** smallest data value

-   Quartiles

    -   $Q_1$ (lower quartile) is the 25th percentile, with about 1/4 of the data below it

    -   $Q_3$ (upper quartile) is the 75th percentile, with about 1/4 of the data above it

## Five Number Summary

**Five Number Summary**= (minimum, $Q_1$, median, $Q_3$, maximum)

-   The five number summary divides the dataset into fourths

```{r}
favstats(~WeekdaySleep, data = SleepStudy)
```

## Other Measures of Spread

**Range**= Max - Min

```{r}
range(~WeekdaySleep, data = SleepStudy)
diff(range(~WeekdaySleep, data = SleepStudy))
```

**Interquartile Range (IQR)**= $Q_3-Q_1$.

```{r}
IQR(~WeekdaySleep,data = SleepStudy)
```

## Summary

| Characteristic |  Resistant   |       Non-Resistant       |
|----------------|:------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Center         |    Median    |           Mean            |
| Spread         |     IQR      | Standard deviation, Range |
| Location       | $Q_1$, $Q_3$ |         Min, Max          |

-   Note that extreme percentiles (such as the 1st or 99th percentiles would be non-resistant unless the sample size were very large).
