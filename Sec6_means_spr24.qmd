## Outline

-   Formulas for Standard Errors\
-   Introduction to the $t$ distribution
-   $t$-based Inference for Means

## Central Limit Theorem

> For random samples with a *sufficiently large* sample size, the distribution of sample statistics for a mean or a proportion is approximately normal.

-   For means, "sufficiently large" is often $n \ge 30$\
-   If the data are normal, smaller $n$ will be sufficient\
-   If the data are skewed and/or have outliers, $n$ may have to be much higher than 30

## Sample Standard Error Formulas

|         Parameter         |       Distribution        |                               Standard Error                               |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|        Proportion         |          Normal           |                    $\sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}$                     |
| Difference in Proportions |          Normal           | $\sqrt{\frac{\hat p_1(1-\hat p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat p_2(1-\hat p_2)}{n_2}}$ |
|           Mean            |       $t$, df$=n-1$       |                           $\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n}}$                           |
|    Difference in Means    | $t$, df$=\min(n_1,n_2)-1$ |                $\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$                |

## SE of a Mean

The standard error for a sample mean can be calculated by

$$
\LARGE 
\mbox{SE}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

## Three Questions

![Three important questions](https://img.gifglobe.com/grabs/montypython/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail/gif/plCDRJc3Bbjv.gif)

## Three Questions ($\pm 1$)

> -   What is the standard deviation of the *population*?

> -   What is the standard deviation of the *sample*?

> -   What is the standard error of the *sample mean*?

> -   What is the *estimated* standard error of the *sample mean*?

## The $t$-Distribution

-   For quantitative data, we use a $t$-distribution instead of the normal distribution

-   Reason: Using $s$ from the sample to estimate $\sigma$ in the SE formula

-   The $t$ distribution is very similar to the standard normal, but with slightly thicker tails (to reflect the uncertainty in the sample standard deviations)

-   Use [StatKey](https://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/theoretical_distribution/theoretical_distribution.html#t) to get $p$-values for hypothesis tests and critical values $t^*$ for confidence intervals.

## Degrees of Freedom

-   The $t$-distribution is characterized by its *degrees of freedom (df)*\
-   Degrees of freedom are based on the sample size
    -   Single mean: $df = n – 1$\
    -   Difference in means: $df = \min(n_1, n_2) – 1$
    -   ANOVA: $df = n – K$
-   The higher the degrees of freedom, the closer the $t$-distribution is to the standard normal.

## $t$-Distribution versus Normal Distribution

## Case Study: Treatments for Anorexia Nervosa {.smaller}

-   **Anorexia nervosa** is an eating disorder characterized by weight loss (or lack of appropriate weight gain in growing children); difficulties maintaining an appropriate body weight for height, age, and stature; and, in many individuals, distorted body image. (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/anorexia-nervosa)

. . .

-   Randomized controlled experiment in the UK to assess effectiveness of two experimental treatments compared with the established *control* treatment (Hand, D. J., Daly, F., McConway, K., Lunn, D. and Ostrowski, E. eds (1993) *A Handbook of Small Data Sets. Chapman & Hall*, Data set 285 (p. 229))

## $t$-Based Formulas

-   Confidence interval\
    $$
    \mbox{sample statistic} \pm t^* \times \mbox{SE}
    $$

. . .

-   Hypothesis test\
    $$
     t=\frac{\mbox{sample statistic}-\mbox{null parameter}}{\mbox{SE}}
    $$

. . .

-   Use the $t$ distribution for $p$-values and critical $t^*$ values.

## Case Study: Treatments for Anorexia Nervosa

-   Today we focus on two groups:
    -   Control: 26 girls
    -   Family therapy: 17 girls

. . .

-   Variables:
    -   Group\
    -   Before Weight (*Wtbef*)\
    -   After Weight (*Wtaft*)\
    -   Gain= After-Before (*Gain*)

## Matched Pairs

-   For a matched pairs experiment, we look at the differences for each pair, and do analysis on this one quantitative variable

-   Inference for a single mean (mean difference)

## Getting the Data into R

Use the following command to import the data into the data frame `Anorexia_2samp`.

```{r, tiny, eval = FALSE}
Anorexia_2samp <-
  read.csv("http://people.kzoo.edu/enordmoe/math261/data/Anorexia_2samp.csv")
```

## Results for the Family Therapy Girls

-   The average before weight of family therapy girls was 83.2 pounds.

-   The average weight gain for girls in the family therapy group was 7.26 pounds.

-   The standard deviation of these gains was 7.16 pounds.

-   The sample size was 17 girls.

# A Few Words about Conditions {background-color="#FF0139"}

## Normality Conditions

-   Using the t-distribution requires that the data comes from a *normal distribution*

-   Note: this assumption is about the population data, *not* the distribution of the statistic.

-   For large sample sizes we do not need to worry about this, because $s$ will be a very good estimate of $\sigma$ and $t$ will be very close to $N(0,1)$.

## Small Samples

-   For **small sample sizes** ($n<30$), we can only use the $t$-distribution if the distribution of the data is approximately **normal**.

    -   Problem: Hard to assess normality for small samples.

. . .

-   If sample sizes are **small**, only use the $t$-distribution if the data look reasonably symmetric and do not have any extreme outliers.

    -   Even then, remember that the $t$ is just an approximation!

    -   In practice, if sample sizes are small, use **simulation methods** (bootstrapping and randomization).

## Summary

::: incremental
-   **Understanding the** $t$-distribution: The $t$-distribution accounts for the additional uncertainty when estimating population parameters using sample statistics, and it has thicker tails compared to the normal distribution.

-   **Inference procedures**: Use $t$-based confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for means, considering the degrees of freedom and conditions for using the $t$-distribution.

-   **Practical application**: Analyzing weight gain data from a study on treatments for anorexia nervosa, applying hypothesis tests and confidence intervals to draw conclusions about treatment effectiveness.
