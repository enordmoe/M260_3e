### Guidelines for Evaluating Posters
- **Content**: Judges whether the poster contains the essential information. Is the research question clear? Are the results well-supported by data analysis?
- **Clarity**: Evaluates how understandable the presentation is. Is it easy to follow the sequence of information? Are the graphs and tables labeled clearly?
- **Visual Appeal**: Reflects how the poster looks. Is it aesthetically pleasing? Does it avoid overcrowding and make good use of white space?
- **Engagement**: Measures how well the team presents their work. Are they confident? Do they make the topic interesting?
- **Teamwork**: Evaluates collaboration. Does every member of the group contribute? Can they all explain different parts of the research?
