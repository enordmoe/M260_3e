## Outline

-   Paired data\
-   Analyzing paired data\
-   Inference for paired data
-   Conditions

## Context: Inference about the Difference in Means for Paired Data

**Paired data** includes the following:

-   Two measurements on each unit\
    :white_check_mark: Same unit measured under different experimental conditions

-   Measurements on a pair of units that go together

    -   Twin studies\
    -   Partner studies

## Context: Inference about the Difference in Means for Paired Data

**Paired data** can arise in several ways:

-   Two measurements taken on the **same unit**\
    :white_check_mark: Before vs. after an intervention\
    :white_check_mark: Same individual under two experimental conditions

-   Measurements on **matched units**\
    :white_check_mark: Twin/sibling studies\
    :white_check_mark: Spouses or partners\
    :white_check_mark: Caseâ€“control pairs (matched by age or background for example)

## Analyzing Paired Data: One-Sample $t$

-   For a matched pairs experiment, we look at the difference between responses for each unit (pair), rather than just the average difference between treatment groups.

-   Get a new variable of the differences, and do inference for the difference as you would for a single mean.

-   Rather than doing inference for a **difference in means**, do inference for the **mean difference**.

## Inference for Paired Data

To analyze the differences, we use the same formulas we already learned for a single mean:

| Standard Error | Confidence Interval | Hypothesis Test |
|:-------------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| $\text{SE}= \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n_d}}$ | $\bar x_d \pm t^* \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n_d}}$ | $t=\displaystyle\frac{\bar x_d}{s_d/\sqrt{n_d}}$ |

where

-   $\bar x_d$ is the average difference
-   $s_d$ is the standard deviation of the differences and
-   $n_d$ is the number of differences (pairs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Conditions for t-Inference for Matched Pairs

::: incremental
1.  Simple random sample of differences\
2.  Population of differences is...
    -   approximately normal OR

    -   sample size of differences is large $(n_d\ge 30)$\
:::


## Summary: Paired Difference in Means


1. **Paired data** arise when two measurements come from the same unit or from matched units.  

2. **Key idea**: Reduce paired data to a single set of *differences* and analyze those.  

3. **Inference**: Apply one-sample $t$ methods to the differences, checking usual conditions.
