## Statistical Test

A **statistical test** is used to determine whether results from a sample are convincing enough to allow us to conclude something about the population.

> An outcome that would rarely happen if a claim were true is good evidence that the claim is not true.

## Statistical Hypotheses: Null

Statistical tests are framed formally in terms of two competing hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$) the statement being tested in a statistical test.
    -   Statement we hope to reject\
    -   Claim that there is no effect or difference

## Statistical Hypotheses: Alternative

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_a$) the statement we expect or hope to be true.
    -   It is typically the research hypothesis\
    -   Claim for which we seek evidence.

## Statistical Hypotheses

-   The null and alternative hypotheses are competing claims about a population.

-   The alternative hypothesis is established by observing evidence (data) that contradicts the null hypothesis and supports the alternative hypothesis.

## Points to Note

-   Hypotheses are statements about **population parameters**.

    -   A **statistic** ($\hat p$, $\bar X$, etc.) should *never* appear in a hypothesis statement; only parameters ($p$, $\mu_1$, etc.) should appear.

-   The null hypothesis always contains an equality

-   The alternative hypothesis always contains an inequality ($<$, $>$, $\neq$)

-   The direction of inequality in the alternative depends on the specifics of the research question of interest

## Evidence

The goal of a hypothesis test is to determine whether the sample data provide enough evidence to refute the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

## Topics to Come

-   How do we *quantify* the strength of evidence against $H_0$ and in favor of $H_a$?

. . .

-   How do we know whether we have enough *evidence* to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$?

## Summary

-   Statistical tests use data from a sample to assess a claim about a population

-   Statistical tests are usually formalized with competing hypotheses:

    -   **Null hypothesis (**$H_0$): no effect or no difference\
    -   **Alternative hypothesis (**$H_a$): what we seek evidence for

-   A hypothesis test examines whether sample data provide enough evidence to refute the null hypothesis and support the alternative hypothesis.
