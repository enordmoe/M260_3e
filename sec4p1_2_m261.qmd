# Section 4.1 Introducing Hypothesis Tests {background-color="#EA6820"}

## Statistical Test

A **statistical test** is used to determine whether results from a sample are convincing enough to allow us to conclude something about the population.

> An outcome that would rarely happen if a claim were true is good evidence that the claim is not true.

## Statistical Hypotheses: Null

Statistical tests are framed formally in terms of two competing hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$) the statement being tested in a statistical test.
    -   Statement we hope to reject\
    -   Claim that there is no effect or difference

## Statistical Hypotheses: Alternative

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_a$) the statement we expect or hope to be true.
    -   It is typically the research hypothesis\
    -   Claim for which we seek evidence.

## Statistical Hypotheses

-   The null and alternative hypotheses are competing claims about a population.

-   The alternative hypothesis is established by observing evidence (data) that contradicts the null hypothesis and supports the alternative hypothesis.

## Points to Note

-   Hypotheses are statements about **population parameters**.

    -   A **statistic** ($\hat p$, $\bar X$, etc.) should *never* appear in a hypothesis statement; only parameters ($p$, $\mu_1$, etc.) should appear.

-   The null hypothesis always contains an equality

-   The alternative hypothesis always contains an inequality ($<$, $>$, $\neq$)

-   The direction of inequality in the alternative depends on the specifics of the research question of interest

## Null Hypothesis

## Evidence

The goal of a hypothesis test is to determine whether the sample data provide enough evidence to refute the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

## Topics to Come

-   How do we *quantify* the strength of evidence against $H_0$ and in favor of $H_a$?

. . .

-   How do we know whether we have enough *evidence* to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$?

## Summary

-   Statistical tests use data from a sample to assess a claim about a population

-   Statistical tests are usually formalized with competing hypotheses:

    -   **Null hypothesis (**$H_0$): no effect or no difference\
    -   **Alternative hypothesis (**$H_a$): what we seek evidence for

-   A hypothesis test examines whether sample data provide enough evidence to refute the null hypothesis and support the alternative hypothesis.

## Key Question

> How unusual is it to see a sample statistic as extreme as that observed, if $H_0$ were true?

-   If it is very unusual, we have statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis

. . .

$\Longrightarrow$ But *how* do we measure how **unusual** a sample statistic is, if $H_0$ were true?

## Quantifying Evidence Against the Null Hypothesis

> To see if a statistic provides evidence against $H_0$, we need to see what kind of sample statistics we would observe, just by *random chance*, **if** $H_0$ were true

<!-- Spinning pennies 20 times and count number of heads. Randomization distribution -->

## Randomization Distribution

-   A **randomization distribution** is a collection of statistics from samples simulated assuming the null hypothesis is true

. . .

-   The randomization distribution shows what values of statistics would be observed, just by random chance, *if the null hypothesis were true*

## Key Question

> How unusual is it to see a sample statistic as extreme as that observed, if $H_0$ is true?

-   A **randomization distribution** tells us what values of statistics we would see just by random chance, *if the null hypothesis were true*

-   Use the distribution to assess how extreme the observed statistic is!

## p-value

-   The $p$-value is the chance of obtaining a sample statistic as extreme (or more extreme) than the observed sample statistic, *if the null hypothesis were true*

-   **Calculate** the $p$-value as the proportion of statistics in a randomization distribution that are as extreme (or more extreme) than the observed sample statistic

## Calculating a p-value

1.  What kinds of statistics would we get, just by random chance, if the null hypothesis were true?
    -   Randomization distribution
2.  What proportion of these statistics are as extreme as our original sample statistic?
    -   $p$-value

## Calculating a p-value: StatKey

## Alternative Hypothesis

-   A one-sided alternative contains either $>$ or $<$

-   A two-sided alternative contains $\neq$

-   The $p$-value is the proportion **in the tail in the direction specified by** $H_a$

-   For a two-sided alternative, the $p$-value is **twice the proportion in the smallest tail**

## Estimating a P-value from a Randomization Distribution

-   **One-tailed alternative**: Find the proportion of randomization samples that **equal or exceed** the original statistic in the direction (tail) indicated by the alternative hypothesis.

-   **Two-tailed alternative**: Find the proportion of randomization samples in the smaller tail **at or beyond the original** statistic and then **double the proportion** to account for the other tail.

## Guidelines for Thinking About p-values

When wording conclusions from a test of significance, you can consider:

-   $.05\le p \le .10 \implies$ *slight* evidence

-   $.01\le p \le .05 \implies$ *some* or *moderate* evidence

-   $p \le .01 \implies$ *strong* or *convincing* evidence

## Summary

-   The randomization distribution shows what types of statistics would be observed, just by random chance, *if the null hypothesis were true*

-   A $p$-value is the chance of getting a statistic as extreme as that observed, *if* $H_0$ were true

-   A $p$-value can be calculated as the proportion of statistics in the randomization distribution *as extreme or more extreme than the observed sample statistic*

-   The smaller the *p*-value, the greater the evidence against $H_0$
