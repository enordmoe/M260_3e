# Statistical Test

A **statistical** test uses data from a sample to assess a claim about a population.  

> An outcome that would rarely happen if a claim were true is good evidence that the claim is not true.  

---

# Statistical Hypotheses

Statistical tests are framed formally in terms of two competing hypotheses:  

* **Null Hypothesis $(H_0)$** the statement being tested in a statistical test.  
    + Statement we hope to reject  
    + Claim that there is no effect or difference  

--

* **Alternative Hypothesis $(H_a)$** the statement we expect or hope to be true.  
    + It is typically the research hypothesis  
    + Claim for which we seek evidence.  

---

# Points to Note

* Hypotheses are statements about **population parameters**.  

--

* A **statistic** should *never* appear in a hypothesis statement; only parameters should appear.  

---

# Statistical Significance

> When results as extreme as the observed sample statistic are unlikely to occur by random chance alone (assuming the null hypothesis is true), we say the sample results are **statistically significant**  

--

* If our sample is statistically significant, we have convincing evidence against $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$.  

--

* If our sample is *not* statistically significant, our test is *inconclusive*.

# Summary

* Statistical tests use data from a sample to assess a claim about a population  

* Statistical tests are usually formalized with competing hypotheses:  
    + **Null hypothesis $(H_0)$**: no effect or no difference  
    + **Alternative hypothesis $(H_a)$**: what we seek evidence for  
    
  
* If data are **statistically significant**, we have convincing evidence against the null hypothesis, and **in favor** of the alternative
