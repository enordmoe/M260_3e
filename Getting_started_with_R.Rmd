## 1. Welcome

This tutorial takes you throught the steps to get R and RStudio up and running on your Windows PC or Mac.

<img src="figures/stickers/RStudio.png" alt="RStudio logo" width="10%"/> is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  

The figure below provides a visual representation of the relationship between R and RStudio. R is the engine that drives our calculations while RStudio is the interactive environment we use to interact with R.  

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/engine-dashboard.png")
```

The remainder of this tutorial will lead you through the steps to install R and the RStudio IDE. These steps apply if you have either a Mac or Windows PC. If you have  a Chromebook or Linux computer, please contact me for help getting setup with R. 


## 2. Installing R

To install R on your own computer,  follow the instructions in the [video here](https://youtu.be/s45YUfs3q8Y)  Instructions are provided for both Mac and PC (latest version for both is 4.2.1 as of June 23, 2022). If you have a Windows PC, this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) will take you directly to the download page for R.





  
  
## 3. Installing RStudio  

Once you have completed installing the engine R, proceed to install the dashboard, the RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Follow the instructions provided in the [short video here](https://youtu.be/O5tsa3i331k). **Note:** The latest version of RStudio Desktop as of September 7, 2022 is "2022.07.1+554". This is the version you should install.




## 4. Installing  R Packages

Once you will need to install a couple R *packages*. R packages are collections of functions and data sets developed by R users that increase the power of R by improving existing base R functions, add new functions, or bundle multiple datasets into a convenient "package." 


The next video ([click here to access](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/2ce1ff07-5676-45e2-bd13-13f2ccd9ac45)) takes you through the steps to install the two R packages we will use most: **mosaic** and **Lock5Data**. Package installation is a one-time operation. Once a package is installed, you do not need to re-install it each time you use R. But you do need to "load" packages at the beginning of your session and the templates I will provide for homework assignments will include lines that do that. 



## 5 Next Steps  

Now that you have completed these installations, you are ready to go. If you have run into problems or have questions, please contact me by Teams or email.
