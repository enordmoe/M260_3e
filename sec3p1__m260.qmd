## Outline

-   Statistical inference

-   Statistics versus parameters

-   Sampling distributions

-   Variability of the statistic: standard error

-   Importance of sample size

-   Importance of random sampling

## Statistical Inference

**Statistical inference** is the process of drawing conclusions about the entire *population* based on information in a *sample*.

A **parameter** is a number that describes some aspect of a **population.**

A **statistic** is a number that is computed from data in a **sample.**

## Parameter vs Statistic

| Measure     | **Parameter** | **Statistic** |
|-------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Mean        |     $\mu$     |   $\bar x$    |
| Proportion  |      $p$      |   $\hat p$    |
| Std Dev     |   $\sigma$    |      $s$      |
| Correlation |    $\rho$     |      $r$      |

-   We use a *statistic* from a *sample* as a **point estimate** of the corresponding *population parameter*.

## Important Points

-   Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.

-   **Key Questions** For a given sample statistic,

    -   What are plausible values for the population parameter?

    -   How much uncertainty is associated with the sample statistic?

-   **Key Answer** It depends on how much the statistic varies *from sample to sample*!

## Sampling Distribution

-   A **sampling distribution** is the distribution of sample statistics computed for different samples of the same size from the same population.

    -   A sampling distribution shows us how the sample statistic varies *from sample to sample*.

## Center and Shape of Sampling Distributions

-   **Center**: If samples are randomly selected, the sampling distribution will be centered around the population parameter.

-   **Shape**: For most of the statistics we consider, if the sample size is large enough the sampling distribution will be *symmetric and bell-shaped*.

**Caution**: These results only hold for random samples and will not apply if the sampling method is biased.

## Standard Error

-   To assess uncertainty of a statistic, we need to know its **sampling variability**, how much it varies from sample to sample.

-   **Standard error (SE)** is the *standard deviation* of a sample statistic.

-   The **standard error** measures how much the statistic varies from sample to sample.

-   The standard error of a statistic is just the **standard deviation of its sampling distribution.**

## What Happens to Sampling Variability as the Sample Size Gets Larger?

-   As the **sample size** *increases*, the variability of the sampling distribution *decreases*.

-   As $n\uparrow$, the statistic gets closer to the corresponding parameter.

-   As $n\uparrow$, $\text{SE}\downarrow$

## Summary {.smaller}

-   **Statistical Inference**
    -   Draw conclusions about a population from a sample.
    -   Parameters (e.g., $\mu$, $p$) describe populations.
    -   Statistics (e.g., $\bar{x}$, $\hat p$) describe samples.
-   **Key Concepts**
    -   Sampling distributions show how statistics vary from sample to sample.
    -   Random samples result in sampling distributions centered around the population parameter.
    -   Large sample sizes often yield symmetric, bell-shaped sampling distributions.
-   **Standard Error (SE)**
    -   SE quantifies sampling variability.
    -   SE decreases as sample size increases, indicating more precise estimates of the population parameter.

## Summary (continued) {.smaller}

-   **Large samples...**
    -   Reduce the standard error.
    -   Provide more accurate estimates of population parameters.
-   **Importance of Random Sampling**\
    Random sampling ...
    -   Ensures unbiased and representative samples.
    -   Is critical for valid inferences.
