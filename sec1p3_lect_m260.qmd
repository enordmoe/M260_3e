## Association is not Causation!

-   Two variables are **associated** if values of one variable tend to be related to the values of the other variable.

Two variables are **causally associated** if changing the value of one variable influences the value of the other variable. Temporal precedence Covariation ($A\rightarrow B$, $\tilde A \rightarrow\tilde B$) No plausible alternative explanation

## Life Expectancy and Internet

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
gf_point(LifeExpectancy ~ Internet, data = SampCountries) |>
  gf_labs(x="Percent with Internet Access")  
```

## Confounding

**Definition:** A third variable that is associated with *both* the explanatory variable and the response variable is called a **confounding variable**

-   Plausible explanation for an association between explanatory and response variables

-   Prevents determining causation.

## Examples of Confounding Variables

Identify a possible confounding variable:

::: incremental
-   More ice cream sales have been linked to more deaths by drowning.

-   The total amount of beef consumed and the total amount of pork consumed worldwide are closely related over the past 100 years.

-   More umbrellas sold correlate with an increase in car accidents.

:::

## Examples of Confounding Variables (continued)

Identify a possible confounding variable:

::: incremental

-   People who vacation in Europe have fewer cavities.

-   Children who take music lessons perform better in school.

-   People who smoke are more likely to get lung cancer (???)

## Life Expectancy and Internet Revisited

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 6}
gf_point(LifeExpectancy ~ Internet, color = ~ Developed, data = SampCountries) |>
  gf_labs(x="Percent with Internet Access")  
```

## Two Primary Methods of Data Collection

-   **Observational study** observing individuals and measuring variables of interest without attempting to influence responses.
    -   Purpose: descriptive, study of associations
-   **Experiment** a study in which the researcher actively controls one or more of the explanatory variables.
    -   Purpose: investigate cause-and-effect relationships

## Randomization

Eliminate confounding factors by **randomization**

-   Randomly assign values of the explanatory variable in an experiment.

## Randomized Experiment

-   The different levels of the explanatory variable are known as **treatments**

-   Randomly divide the units into groups.

    -   Randomly "shuffle" the experimental units before assigning to groups.

-   Randomly assign a different treatment to each group.

-   If the treatments are randomly assigned, the **treatment groups** should be similar.


## Principles of Statistical Design of Experiments

1.  Random allocation into experimental groups

2.  Control the effect of outside variables

    -   A **control group** is a group of subjects from which the treatment of interest is withheld.

3.  Replication on many subjects to reduce chance variation

## More Control Mechanisms

-   **Placebo** a fake treatment that simulates the idea of a treatment of interest

    -   Placebo effect: people experience the effect they think they should be experiencing, even if they arenâ€™t actually receiving the treatment

-   **Double-blind study** neither the participant nor the evaluator knows the participant's treatment

use CNN dog study to discuss principles

## Two Types of Randomized Experiments

1.  In a **randomized comparative experiment**, we randomly assign cases to different treatment groups and then compare results on the response variable(s).

2.  In a **matched pairs experiment**, each case gets both treatments in random order (or cases get paired up in some other obvious way), and we examine individual differences in the response variable between the two treatments.

## Matched Pairs

**Matched pairs** designs have at least two different forms:

1.  Each participant gets both treatments in a random order OR...

. . .

2.  Participants are paired based on some identifiable characteristic and a randomly selected member of each pair gets each treatment.

::: notes
Migraine study:

trigger point injections vs botox injections (and a placebo)

Design 1: each person gets both; Design 2: paired based on severity and frequency of headache and each given 1

## Randomization and Scope of Inference

```{r, out.width = "700px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/statistics1e_fig_01_03.jpg")
```

## Using R to Randomly Assign Treatments

```{r,include=FALSE}
myclass <- read.csv("http://people.kzoo.edu/enordmoe/math260/data/myclasslist.csv")
```

-   Preview structure of **myclass** data frame

```{r, message=FALSE}
head(myclass, n = 7) # first 7 rows
```

## Using R to Randomly Assign Treatments (cont'd)

-   Use the `shuffle()` function from mosaic to randomly shuffle rows

```{r}
library(mosaic)
newlist <- shuffle(myclass)
head(newlist)
```

## Using R to Randomly Assign Treatments (cont'd)

-   Assign the first third to group 1, second third to group 2,...\

```{r,eval=F}
# Group 1
slice(newlist, 1:15)
# Group 2
slice(newlist, 16:30)
# Group 3
slice(newlist, 31:45)
```
