```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=F,message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
library(Lock5Data)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Outline

-   Datasets: cases and variables
-   Types of variables
-   Explanatory and response variables

## The Palmer Penguins Dataset {.smaller}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed((261))
knitr::kable(sample(penguins,8)[,1:8])
```

-   Rows are cases (or obserations)
-   Columns are variables

## The Data Family Tree

## Types of Variables

Data are recorded as either **categorical** or **quantitative**

-   A **Quantitative** variable measures or records an *inherently* numerical quantity for each case.

-   **Categorical** variables divide the data into groups.

## The ICUAdmissions Data {.smaller}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed((327))
knitr::kable(sample(ICUAdmissions,8)[,1:14], row.names = FALSE)
```

## Explanatory and Response Variables

If we are using one variable to help us understand or predict values of another variable, we call the former the **explanatory** variable and the latter the **response** variable.

Examples:\
- Does meditation help reduce stress?\
- Does sugar consumption increase hyperactivity?\
- Do multivitamin supplements increase longevity?

## Kidney Cancer Data

## Kidney Cancer Data

Counties with the **lowest** kidney cancer death rates

![](figs/kidney_low.png){fig-align="center" width="627"}

## Kidney Cancer Data

-   If the values in the kidney cancer dataset are rates of kidney cancer deaths, then the cases are **counties**
-   If the values in the kidney cancer dataset are yes/no, then the cases are **people**
