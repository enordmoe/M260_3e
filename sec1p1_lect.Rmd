# Outline 

- Data  

- Cases and variables  

- Categorical and quantitative variables  

- Explanatory and response variables   

- Using data to answer a question  

---
# Data

- Data are a set of measurements taken on a set of individual units

--

- Data is typically stored and presented in a *dataset*, comprised of variables measured on cases

# The American Community Survey

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/ACS_data.png")
```


- Rows are cases
- Columns are variables

# COVID-19 Data by County

# Flights Data

Source: [US Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Index.aspx)


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
knitr::kable(head(sample(flights[,c("flight","tailnum","origin","month","day","distance","air_time")],orig.ids=FALSE)))
```


--

Categorical - tailnum, origin, flight

--

Quantitative - distance, air_time, month, day  

--

**Careful**: Dates need to be handled with care and are not typical quantitative variables. Context is everything!

# Explanatory and Reponse Variables

If we are using one variable to help us understand or predict values of another variable, we call the former the **explanatory** variable and the 
latter the **response** variable.  
    
  
Examples:  
- Does meditation help reduce stress?  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/01/07/mindfulness_wide-b20c3525971d5796eba9ad993463fffe8faf2bcb-s1500-c85.jpg")
```
