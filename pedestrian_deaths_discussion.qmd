## 2. Demographic Analysis

Look at the breakdown of pedestrian deaths by age, gender, or other demographic categories in the report. Which demographic groups are most at risk for pedestrian fatalities? What insights can you gather from this data? How might public policies or interventions target these at-risk groups?

## 3. Geographical Disparities

Review the geographical data related to pedestrian deaths. Are certain regions or types of roads (e.g., urban vs. rural) more dangerous for pedestrians? What might explain these geographical differences, and how could this information be used to improve pedestrian safety in high-risk areas?

## 4. Temporal Patterns

Does the report provide any data on when pedestrian fatalities are more likely to occur (e.g., time of day, day of the week, or season)? How might this temporal data help in designing more effective safety measures, such as lighting improvements or traffic law enforcement?

## 5. Identifying Primary Factors in Increased Deaths Over Time

Looking at the trends, demographics, and factors such as vehicle types, infrastructure, and human behaviors, what do you believe are the primary causes of the increase in pedestrian deaths over time? Consider the possible roles of technology (e.g., smartphones), urbanization, vehicle design, and other contributing factors.
