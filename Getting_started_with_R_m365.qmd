# 1. Welcome

This tutorial takes you through the steps to get R and RStudio up and running on your Windows PC or Mac.

![R logo](figures/R_logo.svg.png){alt="R logo" width="75"} is the statistical programming language.

![RStudio logo](figures/stickers/RStudio.png){alt="RStudio logo" width="10%"} is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

The figure below provides a visual representation of the relationship between R and RStudio. R is the engine that drives our calculations while RStudio is the interactive environment we use to interact with R.

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/engine-dashboard.png")
```

The remainder of this tutorial will lead you through the steps to install R and the RStudio IDE. These steps apply if you have either a Mac or Windows PC. If you have a Chromebook or Linux computer, please contact me for help getting setup with R.

# 2. Installing R and RStudio

To install R and RStudio on your own computer, go to the site <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/> and follow the instructions [in the video](https://kzoo-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/eric_nordmoe_kzoo_edu/EfpeXTMptt9Iv9wkW3DZtE0Bw4EDu4I9yy4ntXyn4zoKrQ?e=lDVdBi). Installation instructions focus on procedures for a Mac (if you have a Windows computer, here is the URL of a recent YouTube video that demonstrates the installation of R and RStudio on a Windows computer: <https://youtu.be/YrEe2TLr3MI>). Install the **most recent version of the software that is compatible with your computer** which may be newer than what you see in the video. If you have any questions at this stage, feel free to reach out to me.

# 3. Next Steps

Now that you have completed these installations, you are ready to go. If you have run into problems or have questions, please contact me by Teams or email.
