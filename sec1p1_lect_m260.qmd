## Outline

-   Data
-   Cases and variables
-   Categorical and quantitative variables
-   Explanatory and response variables

## Data

-   Data are measurements taken on a set of individual units

-   Data is typically stored and presented in a *dataset*, comprised of variables measured on cases

# Cautions in Research

## The Challenge of Categorization

-   **Race and Categorization in Research**
    -   To understand systemic racism, we categorize people by race, even though race is a social construct.
        -   We use statistics to measure the impacts of systemic racism within these socially constructed categories.
    -   In studying health risks, we categorize by biological traits that may correlate with racial groups, helping to identify disease risk factors.

## Gender and Discrimination

-   **The [Gender Unicorn](https://www.transhealthsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-Gender-Unicorn.pdf)** ![](images/clipboard-1506884744.png){.absolute top="0" right="0" width="100"}

    -   To measure salary discrimination, we classify individuals by sex/gender.
        -   How do we accurately measure salary discrimination across diverse gender identities?
    -   We consider biological characteristics to estimate the risk of sex-linked medical conditions.

## Ethical and Methodological Implications

-   While categorizing people can help us measure important effects, it also risks oversimplification and reinforcing stereotypes.
-   How can researchers balance the need for categorization with the complexities of individual identities?

# Sample Data Sets

## The American Community Survey {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/ACS_data.png")
```

-   Rows are cases
-   Columns are variables

## COVID-19 Data by County

## Flights Data {.smaller}

Source: [US Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Index.aspx)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
knitr::kable(head(sample(flights[,c("flight","tailnum","origin","month","day","distance","air_time")],orig.ids=FALSE)))
```

. . .

Categorical - tailnum, origin, flight

Quantitative - distance, air_time, month, day

. . .

**Careful**: Dates need to be handled with care and are not typical quantitative variables. Context is everything!

## Flights Data Sets: Part 2 {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
knitr::kable(head(airports), digits = 2)
```

# Explanatory and Response Variables

## Definitions

If we are using one variable to help us understand or predict values of another variable, we call the former the [explanatory]{style="color:red;"} variable and the latter the [response]{style="color:red;"} variable.

## Explanatory and Reponse Variables: Example 1

Question: Does meditation help reduce stress?

## Explanatory and Reponse Variables: Example 2

Question: Is coffee helpful for people with depression?
