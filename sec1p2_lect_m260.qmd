## Cooking up a Random Sample?

## Sample versus Population

::: incremental
-   A **population** includes all individuals or objects of interest.

-   A **sample** is the set of cases for which we have data.

-   **Statistical inference** is the process of using a sample to learn about the population.
:::

## Bias vs Sampling Bias

![](figs/arrow_bias.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" height="200"}

::: incremental
-   **Bias** exists when the method of collecting data causes the sample data to inaccurately reflect the population.
-   **Sampling bias** occurs when *the method of selecting a sample* causes the sample to systematically differ from the population.
:::

## Simple Random Sample

![](figs/sampling_from_bowl.png){.absolute bottom="50" right="0" height="250"} When choosing a **simple random sample** of $n$ units, all groups of size $n$ in the population have the *same* chance of being selected for the sample.

. . .

Use a simple random sample to avoid **sampling bias**.

## Using R to Draw a Random Sample

<br>

Generating random integers to select a random sample of 5 students from a class of 30:

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
library(mosaic)
sample(1:30, 5)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
```{r}
#| echo: false
sample(1:30, 5)
```
:::

## Sampling from an R Data Frame

<br>

Randomly sample 3 rows from the **StudentSurvey** data set:

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
library(mosaic)
library(Lock5Data)
# sample of size 3
sample(StudentSurvey, 3)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 0.45em"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(sample(StudentSurvey, 3)) 
```
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Saving a Sample as a New Data Set

<br> Randomly sample $3$ rows from the **StudentSurvey** data set and save to a data set called **mysample**:

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
library(mosaic)
library(Lock5Data)
# sample of size 3
mysample <- sample(StudentSurvey, 3)
mysample
```
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 0.45em"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(sample(StudentSurvey, 3))
```

## Other Kinds of Bias

Recall **bias** occurs when the method of collecting data causes the sample data to inaccurately reflect the population.

::: incremental
-   **Undercoverage** some groups of the population are omitted from the process of choosing the sample.

-   **Nonresponse bias** individuals canâ€™t be contacted or refuse to participate.

-   **Response bias** behavior of respondent or interviewer causes bias.

-   **Wording bias** wording of the question influences the response.
