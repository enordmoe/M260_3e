## Cooking up a Random Sample?

## Sample versus Population

::: incremental
-   A **population** includes all individuals or objects of interest.

-   A **sample** is the set of cases for which we have data.

-   **Statistical inference** is the process of using a sample to learn about the population.

## Graduate school

-   What is the sample?

-   Suppose K College is interested in the proportion of it’s students who want to go to graduate school. What is the population?

-   Can our sample data be generalized to make inferences about the population? Why or why not?

## Sampling Bias

**Sampling bias** occurs when the method of selecting a sample causes the sample to systematically differ from the population.

-   If sampling bias exists, we cannot trust generalizations from the sample to the population.

## Scope of Interest

-   Inference can only extend to a population that "looks like" the sample\
-   Examples:
    -   Study of girls with anorexia\
    -   Tracking disease by those who visit doctors\
    -   Generalizing from experiments in the Arb

## Simple Random Sample {.build}

When choosing a **simple random sample** of $n$ units, all groups of size $n$ in the popuation have the *same* chance of being selected for the sample.

Use a simple random sample to avoid **sampling bias**.

## Using R to Help Draw a Random Sample

Generating random integers to select a random sample:

```{r}
# Sample 5 students from a class of 30
sample(1:30,5)
```

## Using R to Sample from an R Data Frame {.smaller}

Randomly sample $n$ rows from a data set:

```{r,eval=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
library(Lock5Data)
# sample of size 3
sample(ICUAdmissions,3)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
library(Lock5Data)
# sample of size 3
#knitr::kable(sample(ICUAdmissions,3)[,-22], row.names = FALSE)
sample(ICUAdmissions,3)
```

::: footnote
The `orig.id` tells us which rows were sampled but is not needed here since there was an ID variable in the original data.
:::

## Other Kinds of Bias

In general, **bias** occurs when the method of collecting data causes the sample data to inaccurately reflect the population.

::: incremental
-   **Undercoverage** some groups of the population are omitted from the process of choosing the sample.\
-   **Nonresponse bias** individuals can’t be contacted or refuse to participate.\
-   **Response bias** behavior of respondent or interviewer causes bias.\
-   **Wording bias** wording of the question influences the response.
