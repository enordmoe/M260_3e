## Descriptive Statistics

-   To make sense of data, we need to **summarize and visualize** it.

-   **Descriptive statistics:** summarizing and visualizing variables and relationships between variables.

-   Different methods are used for [categorical]{style="color:red;"} and [quantitative]{style="color:red;"} variables.

# Numerical and Visual Descriptions for Categorical Variables

## Summarizing Single Categorical Variables {.smaller}

### Summary statistics :computer:

-   **Frequency table** table showing number of cases in each category

-   **Proportion** number in category/total sample size

-   **Relative frequency table** table showing proportion of cases in each category


### Visualizations  :bar_chart:

-   **Bar chart** height of the bar shows the number (or proportion or percent) of cases in each category

-   **Pie chart** relative area represents proportion in each category (less preferred)

## Frequency Table of Counts

```{r}
tally(~LarkOwl, data = SleepStudy)
```



## Relative Frequency Table

```{r}
tally(~LarkOwl, format = "proportion",
      margins = TRUE, data = SleepStudy)
```


## Bar Chart of Single Variable

```{r}
gf_bar(~LarkOwl, data = SleepStudy)
```

## Bar Chart of Single Variable: with colors


```{r}
gf_bar(~LarkOwl, fill = ~ LarkOwl, data = SleepStudy,
       show.legend = FALSE)
```

## Summarizing Two Categorical Variables: Two-Way Tables

Frequency table used to look at the relationship between two categorical variables

-   Variable 1 categories: rows
-   Variable 2 categories: columns
-   Cell counts (frequencies): number of cases in corresponding row and column categories


## Two-Way Tables Example

Cross classify two categorical variables to investigate their relationship:

```{r}
tally(~EarlyClass + LarkOwl, margins = TRUE,
      data=SleepStudy)
```

## Note: For *EarlyClass*, 0 = "No" and 1 = "Yes"

-   What proportion of students with early classes are Larks?
-   What proportion of students without early classes are Larks?
-   What proportion of Owls have early classes?


## Two-Way Tables Example with Proportions

```{r}
tally(~EarlyClass + LarkOwl, margins = TRUE,
      format = "proportion", data = SleepStudy)
```


## Two-Way Tables Example with Conditional Proportions

```{r}
tally(~EarlyClass | LarkOwl, margins = TRUE,
      format = "proportion", data = SleepStudy)
```

$\Rightarrow$ Conditional proportions are useful for comparing groups but be sure to compute the proportions in the correct direction.


## Bar Charts for Single Variables

```{r, fig.height = 6}
gf_bar( ~ LarkOwl, data = SleepStudy)
```



## Segmented Bar Charts for Two Variables

-   **Segmented bar chart** graphical display of a two-way table of counts

    -   Note use of `factor()` to treat *EarlyClass* as categorical.

```{r}
gf_bar(~ LarkOwl, fill = ~factor(EarlyClass), data = SleepStudy)
```


## Comparative Stacked Bar Charts Comparing Proportions

```{r}
gf_bar(~LarkOwl, fill = ~factor(EarlyClass), data = SleepStudy, 
       position = "fill")
```

-   Note that the function `gf_props()` can also be used to plot proportions when working with categorical data.


## Side-by-Side Bar Charts

-   **Side-by-side** height of each bar is the number of the corresponding cell in the two-way table

```{r, fig.height=4}
gf_bar(~LarkOwl, fill = ~factor(EarlyClass), 
       data = SleepStudy, position = "dodge")
```


## Aesthetic Mappings {.smaller}

-   We control the appearance of graphs in R using *aesthetics*, things we can see

-   Examples of aesthetics include:

    -   position (i.e., on the x and y axes)\
    -   color ("outside" color)\
    -   fill ("inside" color)
    -   shape (of points)\
    -   linetype\
    -   size

-   Each type of graph accepts only a subset of possible aesthetics.

-   Using commands to create graphs makes it easy to reproduce or update them later.
